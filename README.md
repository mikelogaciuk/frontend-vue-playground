## Note

ðŸ§µWhen last time I wrote front-end code? Around 2005.

Last podcast of Lex with DHH, gave me a throwback to web development in the Mid-2000s.

Back then, the front-end or I might say full-stack development; was a wild west. The Php was the powerhouse and whether you were building multi-file sites using include() and require(), or kept things minimalist with a single .php file for a blog (and stored posts in .txt - like many did), it was all about rolling up your sleeves and creating from scratch the hand-crafted piece of code and frustration.

It wasnâ€™t perfect, but those were times were everything seemed to be... simple.

Now? I am re-learning the front-end using Vue and having some good fun with it, but it feels more complex in terms of tooling, ecosystem, and mental overhead. There are build tools, bundlers, single-file components, reactive data flowsâ€”so much abstraction compared to the raw PHP and HTML we hand-coded back in the day.
